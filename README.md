# IMDB-Case-Study

This is one of my first projects in data science. In this project, I explore the IMDB dataset to answer the question of:
How has the trend in the genre of films produced evolved since 1970s?

For more details on the project, and its result please check out the presentation file in the repository.

The focus on research shifts from trends popular all over the world to genres recently popular in hollywood like: Romance, Sci-Fi, History, Action.

This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of Pandas and Numpy dataframeworks in Jupyter. The output graphs were produced using the Matplotlib library.

This project is helpful for anyone looking for an introduction to these frameworks.
